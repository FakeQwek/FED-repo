# Casio Calculator Shop


 
## Design Goals

The Casio Calculator Shop will provide customers with a convenient and easy to use platform to browse and purchase various calculator models.
* As the site owner, CASIO will be able to reach more customers and hence increase revenue through calculator sales
* As a site user, customers will be able to browse and select calculator models suitable for their needs and order them afterwards

## Testing
(To be updated)
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Placeholder:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
